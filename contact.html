		<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><br>
		<p>Q: Who manages this page? Is this information accurate or endorsed by Sachiko?</p><br>
		<p><em>A: This page was constructed and is managed by Matthew Gilbert, a student of the UCLA Musicology program. While this page is not officially endorsed by Ms. Kanenobu, all care was used to produce as accurate and throrough a report of a portion of her life and her words as possible. Quotes may be considered true quotations, recordings are authentic, and the project itself was agreed to and features contributions by Ms. Kanenobu.</em></p><br><br>
		<p>Q: Why did you choose this project? What made you decide to write about this woman's life?</p><br>
		<p><em>A: This question is explored within the capstone paper; in short, I enjoy listening to her music and I think others would to. She has created art that I enjoy and I believe she deserves to be appreciated for bringing that artwork into existence.</em></p><br>
